 Doctors frequently encounter challenges from the absence of clear guidelines for every clinical scenario.

This challenge is multiplied when doctors must treat patients with multiple comorbidities.

On an average
            
- Three out of ten times, doctors are unsure of a diagnosis based on symptoms alone, leading to referrals to specialists and additional tests.
- Research shows that only about 20% of patients are linked to a standard care guidelines and only 4% are backed by high-quality evidence.
            
This predicament necessitates an approach that relies on intution when treating patients. There is a risk of misdiagnosis and a high chance of prescribing the wrong care pathway for the patient.
